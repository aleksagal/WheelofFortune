 ### Introduction
This is a simple wheel of fortune that displays a selected movie from a predefined list. 

### Technology used
This project uses the D3.js library, which is included via a CDN.

### Structure
  1.HTML Structure: The HTML includes the basic structure with a div for the chart and buttons for user interaction.
  2.CSS: Basic styling for the wheel, buttons, and text.
  3.JavaScript: The core logic for creating and spinning the wheel, along with handling user interactions.

### How it should be done
To improve the reset functionality of the wheel of fortune, the application should automatically
reset the wheel once the last element is selected, instead of requiring the user to refresh the browser.
